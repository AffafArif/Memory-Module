# Memory-Module
The students are required to design and implement Memory Module of Operating System.
The program should specify the following:
1. Size of Main Memory
2. Memory Management Technique in use by the system
o The students can choose and justify any technique from the following:
▪ Fixed Partitioning (Equal or unequal size partitions)
▪ Dynamic Partitioning
▪ Paging

• The program should take input processes (from file or command line), which include
their arrival time and total size of each process.
• The memory module should be able to allocate memory to each process as it arrives.
• The current state of memory should always be available. Specify the used and free
spaces.
To design the system, following factors are important and should be discussed:
• Number of input processes (take at least 10)
• Average/max/min size of processes
• Total amount of main memory (RAM) available
